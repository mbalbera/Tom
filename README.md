Welcome to Wide World of Babysitting. Yes you are going to trust your child to a complete stranger

- Parents will have many children 

- Children will have many parents 

- They will be joined by births

- Children will also belong to one babysitter at a time but that should be changeable

- You should build full CRUD for parents and children, all childrens names should be unique

- Obviously you should be able to fire (AKA delete) a babysitter

- babysitters should only be viewable through the childs show page (nest that route!)

- make a welcome page so localhost:3000 has a nice title and can send you to see parents, children, (families if your ambitious) you get it...

BONUS:

- search forms for a child/ babysitter
-
